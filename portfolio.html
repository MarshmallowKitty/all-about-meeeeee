            <h1 style="margin:0px;">I worked with TV producers and Neil Patrick Harris to perfect the scripting and content in a pilot production to be pitched to NBC. Throughout my recurring appearances in pilot episodes, I was able to memorize a random deck of 52 cards in order, navigate around the NYC subway system by memory, solve brain-jumbling visual spatial problems, and more.

          <div class="back">
            <h1 style="margin:0px;">I initiated a collaboration between the Ad Astra School and the nearby Tempest gym. At the time, the school did not have an athletics program. To solve this, I contacted the manager of the South Bay Tempest location and organized a partnership. This included scheduling morning and afternoon SpaceX shuttles to transport students and advertising it to the students. Approximately 60% of the school joined the program in the first year.</h1>

We decided that dehydrated plants with medicinal properties would be tightly packed into designated areas of rockets and sent to space as a way of providing them with necessary nutrients that are naturally grown.</h1>

My teammate and I created 3D designs for a variety of products, as well as testing the material to see what configurations would be most effective. By the end of the designing period, one of our blueprints was chosen to move onto the next round in the manufacturing process.</h1>

They took student-written CONUNDRUMS, simplified ethical dilemmas, and published them for kids everywhere in the world to study. One of my own CONUNDRUMS was animated and released in the first season (“The Treasure Conundrum”).</h1>

          <div class="back">
            <h1 style="margin:0px;">My school’s Robotics program had two teams, with the identifications 92305A and 92305B. We won first place in a regional competition and therefore moved on to the state level during the 2019-2020 school year. Unfortunately, due to COVID restrictions, in-person competitions were discontinued and competitions were held online through simulations of the robots. My task was to oversee the team's progress and assign new jobs based on what was being completed. Then I took note of that progress in the Engineering journal to be directly judged by the panel.
